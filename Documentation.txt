Overview:
This C++ program reads registration numbers from an input file (input.txt) and updates the attendance count for each registration number. It maintains the attendance data in a map (attendance), where each registration number is associated with its attendance count. The program then writes the updated attendance to an output file (output.txt).

Libraries Used:
iostream: Provides input/output stream functionality.
fstream: Provides file stream functionality for file input/output operations.
map: Provides the std::map container for storing key-value pairs.
string: Provides string-related operations and functionalities.
Main Function:
The main function is the entry point of the program. It follows the following steps:

Declare a map attendance to store registration numbers and their attendance count.

Open the existing output file (output.txt) in an input file stream (std::ifstream).

If the file exists, read the existing attendance from the file and update the attendance map accordingly.
Each line in the file is expected to contain a registration number followed by its attendance count.
Close the input file after reading the existing attendance.
Open the input file (input.txt) in an input file stream (std::ifstream).

If the input file fails to open, display an error message and return 1 to indicate an error.
Read registration numbers from the input file and update the attendance count.

Each registration number is read from a line in the input file.
For each registration number, increment the attendance count in the attendance map.
Close the input file after reading all the registration numbers.

Open the output file (output.txt) in an output file stream (std::ofstream).

If the output file fails to open, display an error message and return 1 to indicate an error.
Write the updated attendance to the output file.

Iterate over each entry in the attendance map.
Write each registration number followed by its attendance count to the output file on a new line.
Close the output file after writing the attendance data.

Display a message indicating that the attendance has been updated in the output file.

Return 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.

File Operations:
The program uses std::ifstream to open and read from files (input.txt, output.txt) and std::ofstream to open and write to the output file (output.txt).
It checks whether the files are successfully opened and displays an error message if they fail to open.
The input file is read using the >> operator to extract registration numbers from each line.
The output file is written using the << operator to output the registration numbers and their attendance count.
Map Usage:
The attendance map is used to store the registration numbers as keys and their attendance count as values.
If an existing output file is read, the attendance count for each registration number is retrieved from the file and stored in the map.
When reading the input file, the attendance count for each registration number is incremented in the map using the attendance[regNumber]++; statement.
Error Handling:
The program checks whether the input and output files are successfully opened. If not, it displays an error message and returns 1 to indicate an error.
Console Output:
The program displays a message indicating that the attendance has been updated in the output file (std::cout << "Attendance has been updated in the output file." << std::endl;).
Return Value:
The main function returns 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.
That concludes the documentation for the provided code.
